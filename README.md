Purpose of this project
-----------------------
Image computation using hardware-assisted radiation tracking and associated techniques are currently gaining in importance in real-time computer graphics.
Despite this new hardware support, only a little computing time is required to calculate one
single image. Along with this short computing time, there are fewer paths, and accordingly fewer
Length. Previous work has to be done to counteract the resulting image noise,
included the blue noise error distributions and emphasized and clarified their importance in increasing the perceptible image quality.
This work explains a temporally stable algorithm based on this technique. In contrast to the previous approaches, we want to apply an error redistribution directly in the image space, and so one accordingly
to get correlated pixel sequence. The algorithm achieves all of this without significant additional effort.
